i did alot of things here 
# using intersection observer
i was planning to use scroll events and getboundry and these stuff but,
i think if there is another way to know the is the section in view or not,
and i had started searchig tell i found a magnificent object called
intersection opserver that opserve all time an element intesrsecting with
viewport and return a boolean value =>"isIntersecting" which i use to 
interact with the section in view 

# responsive design
